    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Basics\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipline is an open-source algorithmic trading simulator written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source can be found at: https://github.com/quantopian/zipline\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Realistic: slippage, transaction costs, order delays.\n",
    "* Stream-based: Process each event individually, avoids look-ahead bias.\n",
    "* Batteries included: Common transforms (moving average) as well as common risk calculations (Sharpe).\n",
    "* Developed and continuously updated by [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com) which provides an easy-to-use web-interface to Zipline, 10 years of minute-resolution historical US stock data, and live-trading capabilities. This tutorial is directed at users wishing to use Zipline without using Quantopian. If you instead want to get started on Quantopian, see [here](https://www.quantopian.com/faq#get-started).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have zipline correctly installed, see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline#installation) if you haven't set up zipline yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `zipline` algorithm consists of two functions you have to define:\n",
    "* `initialize(context)`\n",
    "* `handle_data(context, data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the start of the algorithm, `zipline` calls the `initialize()` function and passes in a `context` variable. `context` is a persistent namespace for you to store variables you need to access from one algorithm iteration to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the algorithm has been initialized, `zipline` calls the `handle_data()` function once for each event. At every call, it passes the same `context` variable and an event-frame called `data` containing the current trading bar with open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices as well as volume for each stock in your universe. For more information on these functions, see the [relevant part of the Quantopian docs](https://www.quantopian.com/help#api-toplevel)."

It then uses historical price and volume data of Apple from the `quantopian-quandl` bundle in the desired time range, calls the `initialize()` function, and then streams the historical stock price day-by-day through `handle_data()`. After each call to `handle_data()` we instruct `zipline` to order 10 stocks of AAPL. After the call of the `order()` function, `zipline` enters the ordered stock and amount in the order book. After the `handle_data()` function has finished, `zipline` looks for any open orders and tries to fill them. If the trading volume is high enough for this stock, the order is executed after adding the commission and applying the slippage model which models the influence of your order on the stock price, so your algorithm will be charged more than just the stock price * 10. (Note, that you can also change the commission and slippage model that `zipline` uses, see the [Quantopian docs](https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage) for more information).\n",

If an `analyze()` function is found it will be called *after* the simulation has finished and passed in the performance `DataFrame`.

    "The Dual Moving Average (DMA) is a classic momentum strategy. It's probably not used by any serious trader anymore but is still very instructive. The basic idea is that we compute two rolling or moving averages (mavg) -- one with a longer window that is supposed to capture long-term trends and one shorter window that is supposed to capture short-term trends. Once the short-mavg crosses the long-mavg from below we assume that the stock price has upwards momentum and long the stock. If the short-mavg crosses from above we exit the positions as we assume the stock to go down further.\n",
